                <div id="club-current-book-synposis" class="quote">Joe Tournier has a bad case of amnesia. His first
                    memory is of stepping off a train
                    in the nineteenth-century French colony of England. The only clue Joe has about his identity is a
                    century-old postcard of a Scottish lighthouse that arrives in London the same month he does. Written
                    in illegal English—instead of French—the postcard is signed only with the letter “M,” but Joe is
                    certain whoever wrote it knows him far better than he currently knows himself, and he's determined
                    to find the writer. The search for M, though, will drive Joe from French-ruled London to rebel-owned
                    Scotland and finally onto the battle ships of a lost empire's Royal Navy. In the process, Joe will
                    remake history, and himself. <span class="text-source text-source-parenthesis">(Goodreads)</span>

                            tricky cleverness, and few of those trickily clever books rise to her level of emotional
                            intensity. Suspenseful, philosophical, and inventive, this sparkling novel explores the
                            power of memory and love."
