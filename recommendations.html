            <p>With its winding old town streets, gothic spires piercing the gray skies, and historic
                significance, Edinburgh has enthralled writers for centuries and become the setting of countless
                stories. Here are some of our favourite books set in the fair Scottish capital.</p>

                                Edinburgh's botanical circles are gripped with excitement. In the newly-installed
                                Botanic Garden, the Agave Americana plant looks set to flower - an
                                event which only occurs once in several decades.</p>
                            <p>Newly widowed Elizabeth, just arrived in Edinburgh to put her unhappy past in London
                                behind her, and Belle Brodie, a vivacious young woman with a passion for botany and the
                                lucrative, dark art of perfume creation, meet over their shared excitement for the
                                Garden. Both carry secrets. But
                                as they are about to discover, secrets don't last long in this Enlightenment
                                city. And when they are revealed, they can carry the greatest of consequences...</p>

                    <p>Welcome to Battleschool.</p>
                    <p>Growing up is never easy. But try living on the mean streets as a child begging for food and
                        fighting like a dog with ruthless gangs of starving kids who wouldn't hesitate to pound your
                        skull into pulp for a scrap of apple. If Bean has learned anything on the streets, it's how to
                        survive. And not with fists. He is way too small for that. But with brains.</p>
                    <p>What better quality for a future general to lead the Earth in a final climactic battle against a
                        hostile alien race, known as Buggers. At Battleschool Bean meets and befriends another future
                        commander - Ender Wiggins - perhaps his only true rival. Only one problem: for Bean and Ender,
                        the future is now.</p>
