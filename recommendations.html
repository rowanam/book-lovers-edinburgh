                    <p>The world's best young magicians accept the opportunity of a lifetime. Six are chosen. Only five
                        will walk away.</p>
                    <p>The Alexandrian Society is a secret society of magical academicians, the best in the world. Their
                        members are caretakers of lost knowledge from the greatest civilizations of antiquity. And those
                        who earn a place among their number will secure a life of wealth, power, and prestige beyond
                        their wildest dreams. Five, they are told, will be initiated. One will be eliminated. If they
                        can prove themselves to be the best, they will survive. Most of them.</p>

                    <p>Welcome to Battleschool.</p>
                    <p>Growing up is never easy. But try living on the mean streets as a child begging for food and
                        fighting like a dog with ruthless gangs of starving kids who wouldn't hesitate to pound your
                        skull into pulp for a scrap of apple. If Bean has learned anything on the streets, it's how to
                        survive. And not with fists. He is way too small for that. But with brains.</p>
                    <p>What better quality for a future general to lead the Earth in a final climactic battle against a
                        hostile alien race, known as Buggers. At Battleschool Bean meets and befriends another future
                        commander - Ender Wiggins - perhaps his only true rival. Only one problem: for Bean and Ender,
                        the future is now.</p>
                    <p><span class="book-title-ital">Ender's Shadow</span> is the book that launched <span

                        Card's science fiction classic, <span class="book-title-ital">Ender's Game</span>.</p>

                        <div>Card has taken the venerable SF concepts of a superman and an interstellar war against

                            seamless story of compelling power. This is Card at the height of his very considerable
                            powers...a major SF novel by any reasonable standard.</div>

                        unsolved murders.</p>

                        pushing eighty but they still have a few tricks up their sleeves. Can our unorthodox but
                        brilliant gang catch the killer before it's too late?</p>
