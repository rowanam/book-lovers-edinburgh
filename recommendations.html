            <p>With its winding old town streets, gothic spires piercing the gray skies, and historic
                significance, Edinburgh has enthralled writers for centuries and become the setting of countless
                stories. Here are some of our favourite books set in the fair Scottish capital.</p>

                                Edinburgh's botanical circles are gripped with excitement. In the newly-installed
                                Botanic Garden, the Agave Americana plant looks set to flower - an
                                event which only occurs once in several decades.</p>
                            <p>Newly widowed Elizabeth, just arrived in Edinburgh to put her unhappy past in London

                                Garden. Both carry secrets. But
                                as they are about to discover, secrets don't last long in this Enlightenment

            <p>Many authors have taken inspiration from this city and let its charm seep into their writing and lives.
                Some were born here, some arrived later in life, but all of the following authors have chosen to make
                Edinburgh their home. Below are some of our recommendations from the Edinburgh literary scene.</p>

                                hyper-masculine and violently sectarian world of Glasgow's housing estates. They should
                                be sworn enemies if they're to be seen as men at all. As they find themselves falling in
                                love, they dream of escaping the grey city, and Mungo works especially hard to hide his
                                true self from all those around him.
                            </p>
                            <p>But the threat of discovery is constant and the punishment unspeakable. When Mungo's
                                mother sends him on a fishing trip to a loch in Western Scotland with two strange men
                                whose drunken banter belies murky pasts, he will need to summon all his inner strength
                                and courage to get back to a place of safety, a place where he and James might still
                                have a future.</p>

                        <p>From the Booker-prizewinning author of <span class="book-title-ital">Shuggie Bain</span>,
                            <span class="book-title-ital">Young Mungo</span> is a gripping and revealing story about the
                            bounds of masculinity, the push and pull of family, the violence faced by so many queer
                            people, and the dangers of loving someone too much. It has been shortlisted for the British
                            Book Awards 2023 Fiction Book of the Year.</p>

                                harrowing but gently infused with hope & love. And so exquisitely written. It's a joy to
