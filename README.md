## Creation Process
---

### Strategy

### Scope
The website will have an attractive landing page that contains key information from each of the other pages, and encourages users to continue exploring the site. There will be further pages for the book club, book recommendations and store recommendations. Several of the pages will include images of book covers. The stores page will include videos to give users more informations about stores they may want to visit. The footer will contain a sign up form to join an email newsletter.

### Structure

The header contains a bookish-looking logo and simple navigation bar. The main theme color for the website is a shade of dark maroon (rgb(103,7,7)), similar to the color of old bound books. The home page has an aesthetically pleasing welcome image that matches the theme color.

### Skeleton

I created sketches of the home page on paper to visualise the layout created in my head and to explore different potential layouts.

### Surface

I chose a "bookish" looking for the headings and logo (Playfair Display) and a clean, sans-serif font for the main text (Montserrat) so that the website would have a literary aesthetic but still feel modern. On the landing page, a further cursive font was used for the "welcome to" portion of the heading (Allison). All fonts were chosen from Google Fonts.

The main theme color for the website is a shade of dark maroon (rgb(103,7,7)), similar to the color of old bound books. The home page has an aesthetically pleasing welcome image that matches the theme color. The welcome logo also uses a shade of dark gray as a background (#3e3e3e), which is repeated in the footer when a user hovers over a social media link.

- three books are shown with title and author, cover image and a short story taster

### Design and content changes

Social events section

Book recommendations

- Initially the recommendations section showed books read in previous book clubs, however I realised it didn't make sense to simply recommend random books in the style of a book blog. It fit more to the purpose of the page to recommend books specific to the city of Edinburgh and the country, so while creating the recommendations page I pivoted to this plan and replaced all of the pre-exisinting books with Scotland-relevent ones.

## Future Fixes

Home page footer newsletter signup: form and description are spaced apart using a margin. would prefer to do this using flexbox space-between, but when I changed the footer-form-wrapper div display property to flex, the whole div was shifted to the left, and I don't know why.

Home page, book club section:
- used a workaround to make date and location information blocks the same total width
- in future, would want to find a cleaner solution
