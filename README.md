## Creation Process
---

### Strategy

### Scope
The website will have an attractive landing page that contains key information from each of the other pages, and encourages users to continue exploring the site. There will be further pages for the book club, book recommendations and store recommendations. Several of the pages will include images of book covers. The stores page will include videos to give users more informations about stores they may want to visit. The footer will contain a sign up form to join an email newsletter.

### Structure

The header contains a bookish-looking logo and simple navigation bar. The main theme color for the website is a shade of dark maroon (rgb(103,7,7)), similar to the color of old bound books. The home page has an aesthetically pleasing welcome image that matches the theme color.

### Skeleton

I created sketches of the home page on paper to visualise the layout created in my head and to explore different potential layouts.

### Surface

I chose a "bookish" looking font for the headings and logo (Playfair Display) and a clean, sans-serif font for the main text (Montserrat) so that the website would have a literary aesthetic but still feel modern. On the landing page, a further cursive font was used for the "welcome to" portion of the heading (Allison). All fonts were chosen from Google Fonts.

The main theme color for the website is a shade of dark maroon (rgb(103,7,7)), similar to the color of old bound books. The home page has an aesthetically pleasing welcome image that matches the theme color. The welcome logo also uses a shade of dark gray as a background (#3e3e3e), which is repeated in the footer when a user hovers over a social media link.

## Features
---

### Header and Footer

The header and footer remain consistent throughtout the site.

Header

*insert header image here*

- includes website logo on the left and nav bar on the right
- logo links back to home page when clicked
- on smaller screen sizes, nav bar moves underneath the logo
- nav links are underlined to show current page and become red and underlined when hovered over

*insert logo image here*

- the logo uses Playfair Display, a literary-looking font
- I sketched out the idea for the logo on paper, and wanted two lines of the same width, and where the word "Edinburgh" was shorter than the words "Book Lovers". This was both for aesthetic purposes and to put the emphasis on the theme of books.
- this design for the logo was then achieved using letter spacing and by transforming the height of the second line

Footer

*insert footer image here*

- contains a sign up form for a newsletter, requiring a name and email address to sign up
    - the form validates input and requires both fields to be entered before submission- the sign up button is responsive to mouse hover through the maroon and white colors inverting
- social media links that open in new tabs and turn gray when hovered over
    - social media icons were added from <a href="https://fontawesome.com/" target="_blank">Font Awesome</a>
- copyright information

### <a href="#" target="_blank">Home Page</a>

Welcome Section

*insert welcome section image here*

- the height of the section (500px) was chosen so that there is a large main image that creates a positive aesthetic impression on the user, but enough room underneath to see content from the next section and encourage further scrolling
- a large, high-quality, wide image of books is used on the landing page that remains unpixelated and useable across all device sizes
    - the books and the maroon shades in the image solidify the intent and styles of the website in the mind of the user
- the welcome logo further indicates the purpose and style of the website
    - For the welcome section logo, I added a line saying "welcome to", which I wanted written in a cursive font to again create an aesthetic of writing and literature. I chose the Allison font as it matches the style of the rest of the page and is cursive while still being readable.

All Main Sections

- all of the main sections on the home page have the same height (700px) on large and medium screen sizes to create a consistent structure
- the content is always centered horizontally annd vertically in the section with enough white space around it to not feel crowded
- the margins of the section are decreased on mobile screen sizes in line with common practice

Club Section

*insert club section image here*

- a large, colorful image of the book cover grabs the user's attention and provides information about the upcoming book, which is The Kingdoms by Natasha Pulley
- the heading and text provide further information about the book and the time and location of the meet-up
- a link is then provided to continue to the club page with more information
- The three pieces (heading, image and text) are laid out in such a way that on large screens the book cover image is prominent, providing both color and information, while the heading and text line up with the top and bottom of the image respectively to create a pleasing balance.
    - On medium screen sizes, the heading  moves to the top to give it and the body of text more space.
    - On small screen sizes, the heading, image and text are all stacked on top of each other as there is no longer enough room next to the image for a description.

Recommendations Section

*insert recommendations section image here*

- headings and description introduce this section and let the user know that these are book recommendations for Edinburgh-based and Scottish books
- three books are shown, each with title and author, cover image and a short story taster
- each book belongs to a category of recommendations - these are books that are set in Edinburgh, books that were written by Edinburgh-based authors and books from across Scotland
- the books chosen are:
    - Set in Edinburgh - The Fair Botanists by Sara Sheridan
    - Edinburgh Author - Hamnet by Maggie O'Farrell
    - Scottish Literature - Young Mungo by Douglas Stuart
- see Recommendations Page information below for more about how the books were chosen
- the cover images and descriptions were taken from a variety of sources, all attributed below
- there is then a link to the recommendations page to encourage users to continue reading

*insert image of recommendations section at different device widths here*

- Initially, the three books and their descriptions are displayed in three columns.
- As the screen gets narrower and space becomes tight, the section switches to a horizontal layout where the text is aligned next to the book cover and the images alternate between the left and right. This creates a pleasing balance while also spreading out the information so the section doesn't feel over-crowded.
- At even narrower screen sizes the books stack directly on top of each other.
- On mobile screen sizes, the header, book cover and description all stack on top of each other.
- The above progression of layout in response to screen size changes is consistent with the responsiveness of the first (book club) section and is maintained throughout the site.

Bookstores Section

*insert bookstores section image here*

- this section contains a heading, an image of a person holding books in a bookstore and some text with general information and a list of store styles a user might be looking for
- there is then a link to the stores page to encourage them to learn about the recommended stores

### Other Pages

Heading Section

*insert example heading section image here*

- all pages other than the home page have a heading section with the main heading of the page
- I wanted the heading to have a dark background to visually separate it from the header, and decided the image from the home page would fulfill this requirement while both looking aethetically pleasing and maintaining consistency across the site
- the heading is centered on all pages so it won't look misaligned with any content that follows on the page
- the gray background is slightly darker in these sections than in the home page welcome section to improve readability

### <a href="#" target="_blank">Club Page</a>

About Section

*insert about section image here*

- this section provides information about the monthly book club
- there are two images, one showing two people sitting on a couch reading books, one showing the interior of a cafe
- the text provides information about the ethos of the club as well as practical information

Current Book Section

*insert current book section image here*

- this section provides information about the book that will be discussed at the upcoming book club
- compared to the home page, there is further information about the book
    - the title and author
    - a more extensive taster of the plot
    - a link to a website where the book can be purchased and a suggestion to go to the Stores page if the user is looking for a place to buy the book in person
    - there are three reviews of the book, which are arranged in three columns on larger screens and move to stack on top of one another on smaller screens as space becomes tight
- as the screen size decreases, the cover image becomes smaller to allow more space for the text, and then moves underneath the plot taster
- the section ends with a link to go to the Recommendations page to get other book recommendations
- in terms of layout, the book cover image on this section is on the right to create balance on the page, after the about section before it with images on the left

Find Us Section

*insert find us section image*

- the address of the cafe where the book club is held
- and embedded map showing the location of the cafe
- a contact email is provided so the user can reach out with any questions

### <a href="#" target="_blank">Recommendations Page</a>

Introduction Section

*insert introduction section image*

- a short introduction is provided explaining what is on this page
- the upper and lower margins on this page are decreased compared with other sections as it has no headings or images, and to place it closer to the main page heading

Other Sections

- this page contains three main sections showcasing three different categories of books - set in Edinburgh, written by Edinburgh-based authors and Scottish literature
- each section contains
    - a main heading
    - a short description of the content of that section
    - one featured book, with a title and author, a large cover image, a story taster, a short comment on the book and its accolades, a review of the book, and link to further information about the book on Goodreads - this information is all useful to a user who wants to learn more about Scottish and Edinburgh-based books
    - further book recommendations that fall within that category, three newly written books and three older classics
- the layout of the sections was created so that there is an overarching description on top, a middle portion that is balances between an image and text, and a final wide portion at the bottom that is visually separated by lines on the top and bottom, overall creating a balanced presentation of information

*POSSIBLY ADD SOME IMAGES ABOVE OF THE RELEVANT PARTS FROM SECTION ABOVE*

*image of a more books div here*

- more book recommendations are provided in a delineated portion at the bottom of each section
- initially, the book are listed with the heading describing the books on the left, separated from the list by a line as this layout is the most visually pleasing on large screens
- as the window gets smaller, the headings of the lists move above the lists, then the descriptor for the portion moves aboves both lists, and finally the two lists stack above each other

- as in other sections, the heading and text are first aligned next to the image, then everything moves to be stacked on top of one another on smaller screens

More Stores Section

*image of more stores section*

- a short description of this section
- two embedded YouTube videos are provided showcasing more bookstore recommendations in Edinburgh
    - this provides the user with more information while also increasing the interactivity and visual activity of the website
    - the videos can be controlled by the user

### Future Features

Social Events Section
- The project was initially planned to have a further page listing other social events set up by members of the community. This would increase user value by creating more opportunities to engage with the book loving community in Edinburgh, and is a feature that would be good to add in future.

Burger Menu
- It is standard practice to collapse the navigation into a "burger menu" on mobile devices, and this is feature that would also look nice on this website in the future.

### Major Feature Changes

Social Events Section
- As discussed above, the plan for the project intially included a social events section, which is present in earlier versions and was removed during the project creation.

Book Recommendations
- Initially the recommendations section showed books read in previous book clubs, however I realised it didn't make sense to simply recommend random books in the style of a book blog. It fit more to the purpose of the page to recommend books specific to the city of Edinburgh and the country, so while creating the recommendations page I pivoted to this plan and replaced all of the pre-exisinting books with Scotland-relevent ones.

### Three Part Layout

A structure I used frequently throughout the site is the "three part layout" of a heading, an image and a body of text that start off with the image on one side and everything else aligned on the other side, moving to the heading being place on top, and then having everything stacked.

*insert image of an example of this structure, e.g. home page club section*

This was one of the first styles for the website that I developed and I experimented with how to do it on a simplified code using <a href="#" target="_blank">Brackets</a>. 

*images of Brackets layout testing here*

The best way I was able to find to achieve my desired layout was using a flexbox where initially the image was positioned absolutely, taking it out of the document flow, and the other content was positioned in the flexbox in a column. This allowed good control of the vertical positioning of these items, for example, meaning the "learn more" links that frequently appear at the bottom of the text blocks in instances of this layout on the website align with and stick to the bottom edge of the image, even as the screen size and text breaking changes. 

To create responsiveness, as the screen size changed to a medium screen, I changed the flexbox to row positioning with the heading assigned 100% and the image position returned to static, which put the heading on top while aligning the image and text block next to each other. Finally, on smaller screens, it was then easy to return the flexbox to a column oritentation and stack all of the pieces on top of one another.

This layout structure worked relatively well, allowing me to easily switch orientations for different screen sizes and controlling how the text was vertically positioned on larger screen sizes by utilising flex-grow and space-between properties and style rules. 

However, this certainly was not the cleanest solution as it required manual defining of the width of the text and heading when they were placed next to the image, and which I had to redo whenever the image size changed. Therefore, in future updates I would find a cleaner way to accomplish this layout and refactor the code accordingly.

### Responsiveness

Since many of the pages and sections had different content, layouts and amounts of text, I had to create several different responsiveness structures throughout the website. This was the aspect of building the website that took by far the longest, and was much more challenging than I expected.

The main ways I made the site responsive (in terms of layout, not link hovering or so on) were by:
- centering all the content within each section using flexboxes and then decreasing the margins around the content on smaller screen sizes
- changing the layout of content so it would appear balanced and spaced out correctly on all screen sizes, especially using the three part layout structure discussed above
- having headings and short pieces of free-floating text initially centered on the page, then aligned left on mobile screen sizes

For some sections I then also created specific responsiveness rules that matched the requirements of that block of content. All of these changes were consistent to the best of my knowledge with pleasing design and common practice. 

Initially I coded each section to respond to screen size changes individually, according to how its content moved around. After completing a few sections I realised there were some points that made the most sense to create media queries for - 1000px, 830px and 620px, which I approximated as being medium screen sizes, horizontal mobiles and vertical mobiles. These were chosen because they are the points on this site where content would consistently get so crowded or strange-looking that a layout change was needed. Other media query widths are used for specific sections that needed a layout change a different points.

I also realised that some of the concepts of how the sections should respond to screen size changes were similar, so I went back and refactored some of the style rules to make more universal responsiveness styles that applied to multiple sections, removing some of the individual styling I had created along the way. However, as I was learning this as I was going along, I can see that there are more ways I could consolidate responsiveness rules to decrease the complexity of the code and make it easier to navigate, or easier to add more sections in the future. Therefore, another future fix I would make is refactoring the responsiveness style rules to make the css simpler and cleaner.

## Bug Fixes
---

Signed up page box overlap with footer
- On either short or narrow screen sizes, the "thank you for signing up to the newsletter" box overlapped with the footer at the bottom. 
- On large and medium screen sizes, this was fixed by setting a minimum height, as the height of the box was fixed and so it was easy to calculate the appropriate minimum height.
- On vertical mobile devices, the height of the box was set to fit-content. I wanted the footer to be at the bottom of the page if space allowed, and then to be pushed further down if the box became too long and overlapped with the footer. I tried to do this by setting the minimum height of the section to the height of the box plus its margins, but this didn't work. I fixed the main issue, which was the box overlapping with the footer, by picking a minimum height that would work for even very narrow screens (600px), so the box should never overlap. However, in future I would like to find a cleaner solution to achieve my original plan of having the footer always at the bottom of the page if space allows.

---
## Known Bugs and Future Fixes
---

Home page footer newsletter signup: form and description are spaced apart using a margin. would prefer to do this using flexbox space-between, but when I changed the footer-form-wrapper div display property to flex, the whole div was shifted to the left, and I don't know why.

Home Page book club section date and location
- used a workaround to make date and location information blocks the same total width
- in future, would want to find a cleaner solution

Page heading sections
- On small screen sizes, h1 breaks onto multiples lines and automatically takes up the full width of the parent. In future I would like to find a way for the width of the element to "shrink-wrap" to stay the width of the text content so the padding with background color does not extend to the edges of the section.

Nav bar on small screens
- On some narrow screen sizes (e.g. Galaxy Fold), the nav bar wraps onto the next line. I attempted to mitigate this issue by reducing the spacing between menu items a little so it would work well on more screen sizes, but in the long run the best fix would be a burger menu.
